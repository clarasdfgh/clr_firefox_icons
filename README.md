# Clr's firefox icons

Just a repo to store the icons I made for my firefox bookmarks. You can use them if you want to.

These were made in Krita (which I am aware is not the best option). I eyeballed them with some rulers and the "guia" layer, cos I wasn't about to download some graphic design software when I was already procrastinating by making these.
To export all layers in different files from Krita, do Tools > Scripts > Export layers.

I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) for the palettes.

Might update if they end up looking ugly. **UPDATE:** ok, they look great, probably won't change them. Might add more if my bookmarks needs require it.
